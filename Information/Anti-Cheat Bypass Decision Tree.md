## Anti-Cheat Bypass Decision Tree

**Recap:**
- The anti-cheat has been identified
- The anti-cheat is obfuscated

Now based on the information, we have now identified the anti-cheat and know that its obfuscated.

Since its obfuscated you have two options which will vary on your skillsets & circumstances.

Option 1 (Recommended): Deobfuscate the script so you can directly identify everything about the anti-cheat and how to bypass everything
Option 2: Debug the script by hooking functions to see how they are called and their return results and infer what they do depending on the results

Due to my circumstances and skillsets of not being able to deobfuscate scripts but being able to debug obfuscated scripts and identify what they do from the debugging I decided to personnaly pick option 2
